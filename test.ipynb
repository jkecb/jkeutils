\u001b[39m一，不遵守任何已知的经济学定律。举例，你在英格兰旗人开的普通超市花2镑购买了一个平平无奇也无任何标记的普通石榴，你拿回家切开后发现这个石榴酸得不能吃；不是普通意义上的酸得不能吃，而是它在品种上是中亚地区人民拿来当柠檬/醋替代品的餐饮用黑籽石榴，一般是用来拌在抓饭里解腻提味的。如果你在淘宝上买石榴，这个品种的石榴是有小部分果农种的，专供特色餐厅/嗜酸的孕妇，在出售的时候会特意标注品种不同。有些果农两种都种，会在销售页面大字标识“这不是红籽甜石榴而是黑籽酸石榴，有些人很难接受，慎买勿随意差评”。于是你看着手中的黑籽石榴眉头一皱，觉得这个超市不讲武德。你起身去英格兰旗人开的农产品集市上花5镑购买了一个有机石榴，打开一看发现依然是黑籽酸石榴；你再去英格兰旗人开的高端小资cottagecore风格精品生鲜食品店里买了一个9镑的硕大美观的石榴，合人民币八十多块钱，结账的时候店主温柔地冲你笑给你介绍新到货的石榴多么新鲜和可爱，还送给你一小袋本郡产的红茶，直到回家你打开这个石榴发现依然是个对部分人来说不可食用的黑籽酸石榴。你疲惫地瘫在沙发上，发现自己花了人民币一百五十块钱跑了两天只学到了一个道理，就是旗人的领地里只有黑籽酸石榴，就算你愿意出钱出到不合理的地步也只能买到黑籽酸石榴，旗人可能不承认人间有黑籽酸石榴以外的任何石榴，你要是想吃人间其他石榴你必须得离开旗人区找见多识广的绿哥店、三哥店和韩超。但是旗人超市冷藏区里那个全球都有的pom开头葫芦形瓶子的鲜榨石榴汁里又是正常的石榴汁，味道和品种和北美超市里的一模一样，它能一直存在说明销量还可以，你没法理解英格兰旗人是怎么调和这种认知冲突的，你也不敢细想。黑籽酸石榴格外好种吗？成本便宜吗？气候需求不同吗？可是淘宝上很多果农两种都种，黑籽酸石榴比红籽甜石榴售价还普遍每箱略贵十块钱呢。没有任何经济学原理能够解释英格兰这种现象。尽管这片土地诞生了亚当斯密和凯恩斯，但是你发现经济学不存在了。我甚至不禁怀疑莫非是因为这片土地上经常经济学匪夷所思地不存在所以能够诞生出反思经济学的亚当斯密和凯恩斯。\u001b[39m\n\u001b[0;32m

\u001b[39m二，不受当地物产的物理限制。英格兰旗人是不太会做也不太会吃鱼虾蟹和其他水产的，尽管它是个岛国，开车到海边花不了三个小时，尽管它河道纵横，多数有历史的大学都以划船为乐。这种不太会做不太会吃不是你没见过人做，而是你在伦敦以外哪怕是个繁荣的小城市就会连买都买不到。在英格兰旗人开的超市里你是买不到有头有尾带骨头的鱼、带头带壳的生虾、更见不到生章鱼，就更别说新鲜的螃蟹和其他壳类水产了，就连海带都只有干货并被认为纯属日本特色。而且尽管英格兰气候温和，什么奇奇怪怪的花果都好活，但旗人只会把这些东西搜集到花园里，而从不出现在餐桌上。英格兰旗人的食谱和做法总以一种很特殊的匮乏到无限接近于前中世纪黑暗时代的形式出现，就是你去纬度一样的比利时发现比利时人至少吃加香草的葡萄酒奶油炖青口和烧烤酱烤猪肋排，纬度一样的北部德国发现德国人至少吃纯肉香肠和大猪肘子，就连纬度一致的毛子区都有很香的土豆沙拉、罐焖牛肉、家常包菜汤和格瓦斯。我在英国待久了在瑞典转个机逛逛机场差点眼泪都感动得掉下来，机场里随便一个便利店卖的坚果居然不潮不苦没有哈喇子味很香脆，袋装糖果居然香精味不冲鼻子还软弹不粘牙，随便一个咖啡店卖的小面点居然不齁不干巴是好吃不腻的，咖啡居然不苦不烫是醇香的，这在旗人区想都别想，纯属做梦，我在英国被练得看到陈列着满满食物的橱窗第一反应不是嘴馋而是恐惧和反胃。我去埃及最南端边境跟动不动政变打枪的苏丹接壤的黑皮努比亚农家乐，发现这帮裤子都快穿不起的水库移民吃得比英格兰旗人好多了，塔吉锅慢炖到酥烂的骆驼肉比羊肉少膻味比牛肉多胶质，香料用得出神入化，烤鸽子肚子里填了米饭，米饭以外的鸽子皮肉的处理水平堪比一流水平的老广餐厅。穷得全村唯一一个饭店是预制板和木棍搭个露天棚子、铁皮凑合弯个烤炉、厕所是旱厕、开高速路过快饿昏了才会下高速瞅一眼的南美山沟沟里的小村庄都至少日常吃又嫩又多汁的烤猪肉片和新鲜的整条炸鱼，薄薄一层脆皮油香四溢，各种辣酱和柠檬调味，各路鲜榨果汁管够。英格兰旗人的调味汁只有gravy，也就是咸到发苦除了咸味之外没有任何味道甚至连肉味都没有的煮肉渗出来的血水再勾芡，在此之上狠加不是很新鲜也不是很大颗近乎无味的现磨黑胡椒甚至已经打碎不知道放了多久的黑胡椒粉。英格兰旗人可接受的食材只有猪牛羊鸡、整块无刺的一碰就烂的不新鲜鱼肉，煮到稀烂的水果。做法一定是煮熟/烤熟加gravy，腥得一端上来就能一波热浪逼得人战术后仰，或者裹面炸熟，面比内容物更厚更硬，一口下去剌得口腔黏膜出血。土豆、胡萝卜、洋葱，此外菜花一定煮不熟，豆角一定嚼得腮帮子发酸，青菜一定煮过，苦得让人怀疑人生，并且以上全都不调味。饮料？咖啡、茶、酒，其中前两样都是进口的，而且只进最次的，或者说是旗人的口味只偏好最次的，咖啡永远是中药味，所有英国本土连锁咖啡店做咖啡都能给你做出滚烫正宗的中药味，茶永远是刷锅水高末，就连伊丽莎白二世生前最爱的那个高贵的蓝绿色牌子fortnum & mason也次得一口让人回想起二战的血火与荒凉。我都不好意思拿中国茶出来欺负人，就连土耳其的、意大利的、甚至巴黎老城区主业做巧克力的老字号甜品屋顺手做的支线产品伯爵茶都能吊打三大英国御用茶品牌全部加在一起。除了土产金酒之外好喝的酒全靠法国葡萄牙。英格兰是不产其他东西吗？不是的，虽然我花园百花齐放，地上河网密布，气候温和，生态极佳，但这一切跟我的餐桌有什么关系？我吃到类似水平的菜在全球只有撒哈拉沙漠里的帐篷民宿，从摩洛哥最南端的城市出发向南进沙漠开车三个小时走到高速公路尽头，再换吉普车骑着沙子开四十分钟的那种柏柏尔游牧帐篷。人那是不想做不会做吗？那是真的啥也不长，就这都至少要挣扎着拿橄榄和柠檬调调味。我在从英国飞往美国的美联航飞机上吃到乘务组从美国带来的铝盒飞机餐盒饭感动得吃得一口不剩，因为这比全城九成的餐厅都要好吃。我在土耳其街头捧着骗游客的半生不熟的街边摊生烤栗子吃得头都不抬，我从国内来找我玩的发小尝了一口百思不得其解，我大喊这实在是太好吃了踏马的英国人不做这个这实在是太好吃了。英格兰正十字旗核心区松鼠和兔子满地蹦跶，鸭子和大鹅到处乱逛，在我老家种了就被冻死所以只能想想的果树在英国冬天连片叶子都不掉，但英格兰旗人非常擅长在没有困难种什么长什么捞什么有什么的环境里给自己制造极端的匮乏。\u001b[39m\n\u001b[1;32m

\u001b[39m英国菜难吃和穷人没有关系。英国菜难吃可能跟人类都没有什么关系。因为我实在不能理解也难以言喻，穷富不能解释，纬度不能解释，物产和气候不能解释，经济学不能解释，与其他文明的接触不能解释，就连工业革命、金融革命乃至一战二战，全都不能解释英国菜之难吃。我只能劝大家远离克苏鲁洼地。如果逃离河南是小润，那么逃离英格兰更是小润。不要和克苏鲁战斗，甚至不要试图想象和理解洼地，你会精神失常得一败涂地。为什么那么多人跑去英国拼命分享自己在克苏鲁洼地体面漂亮的生活？直视克苏鲁真相却离奇地没有疯狂的人，ta一定此前就是个精神病。\u001b[39m\n\u001b[0;32m

\u001b[39m归根到底，我认为英格兰饭不应该被称为难吃，而应该被判决为反人类罪。苏纳克上台的时候我击节叫好，并认为是一场伟大大换家事业的里程碑式的一步。如果一群类人生物占着一块物产丰富的珍贵的地球土地却不做相应的产出好好应用它的潜能反而把一切食材都污染成猪食，那么不如让给阿三，至少他们会煮很香的咖喱。\u001b[39m\u001b[39m'''\u001b[39m\n\u001b[0;32m

    "三，规则类怪谈级别的干扰和妨害你的正常认知，使你怀疑自己的理智和精神状况。上面已经提过了，就像是石榴只有在伊朗被当醋用的黑籽酸石榴一样，你以为你在超市买到的是芒果、甜瓜、草莓、橙子、苹果、李子，啃一圈就能发现你买的是萝卜、萝卜、萝卜、萝卜、萝卜和萝卜，还是不甜不脆木了吧唧的萝卜，品质不错的国产水果萝卜可能都要比旗人超市里花里胡哨的各路水果要甜脆多汁一些。并且在旗人商店里这一点丝毫不为水果的售价而改变，除非你去中东人和三哥开的店里逃命，才能买到一点人间的东西。英格兰旗人店的水果不是阳光下的自然造物，而是物流业的悲惨残渣。另外我在全世界吃到的牛排尽管有品质差异和厨师水平差异，确实至少除了某些廉价预制牛排之外都是牛肉的质地、口感和味道。我曾在旗人饭店里从便宜大碗的街区饭店到金碧辉煌的专业餐厅不信邪地尝试过很多块菲力牛排，20镑一块的牛排端上来，看起来和任何地方的牛排别无二致，叉子往肉里一叉准备切的时候，这块肉像一个肉丸子一样烂掉了，勉强塞进嘴里也像吃了一口肉丸子。30镑一块的牛排，叉子插进去烂掉了；50镑一块的牛排，叉子插进去烂掉了。牛排这种东西说到底不是什么非常高端的玩意，从经济史来看其实主打一个产业供应链规模经济，在美洲20镑就能吃到理应相当不错的，专业牛排馆30镑能吃得快乐升天，即便是在北上，花50镑这个价在正确的地方也总能获得一块正经货。但你人在旗人区只能不断用这些记忆提醒自己，牛排不是这样的牛排不是这样的牛排不是这样的，直到天长日久你总会忍不住怀疑自己记忆的正当性，你试了七八九十家店你愿意出越来越多的钱可你发现事情总是这样，所以五分熟的菲力牛排是不是真的就是叉子一碰就烂掉，也一滴肉汁都没有的大颗肉丸子啊？所以芒果甜瓜是不是真的就是萝卜味啊？什么是芒果？什么是萝卜？芒果？萝卜？世界上真的有芒果吗？世界上真的有萝卜吗？什么是菲力牛排？什么是餐厅？什么是食物？我是谁？芒果芒果芒果萝卜萝卜萝卜牛排牛排牛排丸子丸子丸子餐厅餐厅餐厅，我我我我我，石榴！萝卜！餐厅！萝卜！狮子头！啊啊啊！san值清零。这对一个把吃口好饭当做起床和活着动力的人能造成多大的精神创伤你们能理解吗？\n",
    "英格兰的食物和餐厅看起来都是非常体面像模像样的。英格兰的旗人和文化也看起来都是非常体面像模像样的。英格兰的这类产业不是营销，而是传销级别。澳洲是英格兰流放犯了罪的人的地方，而英格兰是欧洲流放犯了罪的厨子的地方。我最后不得不痛苦地总结出了一个阴谋论，我认为英格兰早就被蜥蜴人污染了。一定是牛剑某个科学实验室的疯狂科学家引来了外星蜥蜴人，蜥蜴人早就替换掉了英格兰核心区的所有厨子甚至更多人，蜥蜴人在努力地扮演地球人，只要你扑上去撕扯他们的脸皮，他们就会露出布满鳞片的真容。不然怎么会所有的餐厅所有的食物都会像模像样地尽善尽美地端上来，但你一塞进嘴里就会发现出大事了，这不可能是人类做出来的东西，这不可能是人类接受和喜欢的口感和味道。这些蜥蜴人在努力制作人类平时在吃的东西，但他们认为只要复刻食物的外形和呈现方式就可以，因为他们根本没有人类的味觉系统，他们觉得吃起来都一样，甚至根本不吃人类概念上的食物。他们也根本没有拓展菜谱和做法的意识，因为他们降临地球的时候食物大致就是那个样子的，他们一直照做就可以了，因为自己不吃人类食物因此不能理解人类口味的逻辑和求新求变的想法，而且以他们的思维方式做创新菜会很容易被拆穿不是人类，可能会加入矿石、硅、辐射物或者不知道什么东西。\n",
    "而且这是当代的新事吗？不是的。我看罗素晚年的访谈，他在爷爷家长大，家里提倡英格兰旗人典型的孩子净饿一饿身体才好，自己要常记先祖的艰苦朴素吃白肉，孩子更要严管。于是大人可以吃好东西，也就是苹果派，而小朋友罗素只能吃更简单的食物，也就是米布丁。小时候的罗素对大人的饮食垂涎三尺，然而英格兰的苹果派和米布丁有多难吃谁吃谁懂。那么罗素的爷爷是什么人呢？他家很困难吗？罗素家里次子，他的爷爷是约翰·罗素勋爵，两度出任英国首相，罗素的爸爸很早就去世了，给他哥哥留下一个伯爵爵位。那时候的英国是什么情况呢？罗素生于1872年，那是大英帝国的巅峰时代，1760-1840年第一次工业革命，1840年第一次鸦片战争，1848年英国皇家海军冒险队探索完全球从此人类的地理冒险基本结束，1851年第一次万国博览会，1860年第二次鸦片战争结束，1870年普法战争开始，从此世界上除了制海权问题之外才有了帝国主义，不列颠治下的和平第一次出现一丝裂缝，此前不列颠海军一直独霸全球各大洋贸易和军事航线，而1880年罗素在首相爷爷家吃着米布丁渴望苹果派，渴望到满头白发对着镜头还委屈到哽咽。这很难评，我没法评。\n",
    "英国菜难吃和穷人没有关系。英国菜难吃可能跟人类都没有什么关系。因为我实在不能理解也难以言喻，穷富不能解释，纬度不能解释，物产和气候不能解释，经济学不能解释，与其他文明的接触不能解释，就连工业革命、金融革命乃至一战二战，全都不能解释英国菜之难吃。我只能劝大家远离克苏鲁洼地。如果逃离河南是小润，那么逃离英格兰更是小润。不要和克苏鲁战斗，甚至不要试图想象和理解洼地，你会精神失常得一败涂地。为什么那么多人跑去英国拼命分享自己在克苏鲁洼地体面漂亮的生活？直视克苏鲁真相却离奇地没有疯狂的人，ta一定此前就是个精神病。\n",
    "归根到底，我认为英格兰饭不应该被称为难吃，而应该被判决为反人类罪。苏纳克上台的时候我击节叫好，并认为是一场伟大大换家事业的里程碑式的一步。如果一群类人生物占着一块物产丰富的珍贵的地球土地却不做相应的产出好好应用它的潜能反而把一切食材都污染成猪食，那么不如让给阿三，至少他们会煮很香的咖喱。'''\n",

It is important to exclude the dishonorable flag bearers and flag traitors who have betrayed the flag either physically or spiritually. The cooking skills of this polluted area and these pure-blooded flag bearers are extremely mysterious and profound. It is incomprehensible and unbelievable how bad the food tastes, even for someone who has traveled all over the world. Nowadays, this incomprehensibility has reached an indescribable level. I will give a few examples, in increasing order of horror: First, not adhering to any known economic laws. For example, if you buy an ordinary pomegranate for £2 from a supermarket owned by an English flag bearer, and it turns out to be so sour that you can\\'t eat it. I don\\'t mean sour in the ordinary sense, but rather that it is a pomegranate with black seeds from Central Asia, which the local people there use as a substitute for lemon/vinegar in their meals. It is usually used to add flavor to pilaf. If you buy pomegranates on Taobao, this variety of pomegranate is grown by a small number of fruit farmers and is specifically sold for specialty restaurants/pregnant women who enjoy sour tastes, and the sale page will clearly indicate the different varieties. Some fruit farmers grow both types and will have a large label on the sales page saying \"This is not a sweet red seed pomegranate, but a sour black seed pomegranate. Some people find it difficult to accept, so please be careful before purchasing and do not leave negative reviews without reason.\" So, you look at the black seed pomegranate in your hand, frown, and think that this supermarket doesn\\'t have any integrity. You get up and spend £5 at a farmer\\'s market owned by an English flag bearer to buy an organic pomegranate, and when you open it, you find that it is still a sour black seed pomegranate. You then go to a high-end boutique fresh food store owned by an English flag bearer to buy a £9 large and beautiful pomegranate, which costs over 80 RMB. The owner gently smiles at you during checkout and introduces the new arrival of pomegranates, how fresh and lovely they are, and even gives you a small bag of locally produced red tea. But when you open the pomegranate at home, you find that it is still a sour black seed pomegranate that is inedible for some people. Exhausted, you collapse on the sofa, realizing that you have spent 150 RMB and two days running around to learn only one lesson, that is, in the land of flag bearers, there are only sour black seed pomegranates. Even if you are willing to spend an unreasonable amount of money, you can only buy sour black seed pomegranates. Flag bearers may not acknowledge the existence of any pomegranates other than sour black seed ones. If you want to eat other types of pomegranates, you have to leave the flag bearer area and find the shops run by knowledgeable green brothers, third brothers, and Korean brothers. However, in the frozen section of flag bearer supermarkets, there is a globally available pomegranate juice with a pommel-shaped bottle that tastes normal, with the same flavor and variety as the one found in North American supermarkets. Its continuous existence indicates that sales are still good. You can\\'t fathom how the flag bearer manages to reconcile this cognitive conflict, and you dare not think further. Are sour black seed pomegranates particularly good to grow? Are they inexpensive? Do they have different climate requirements? However, on Taobao, many fruit farmers grow both types, and the price of sour black seed pomegranates is generally more expensive per box than sweet red seed pomegranates. There is no economic principle that can explain this phenomenon in England. Although Adam Smith and Keynes were born in this land, you find that economics no longer exists. I even can\\'t help but suspect that perhaps it is because this land often experiences economic inexplicabilities, that Adam Smith and Keynes, who reflect on economics, were born here. Second, not limited by the physical limitations of local produce. English flag bearers are not good at cooking or eating fish, shrimp, crab, and other seafood, even though it is an island nation and it takes less than three hours to drive to the coast. Despite the numerous rivers in England, in most prosperous small cities outside of London, you can\\'t even find fresh seafood to buy. In flag bearer supermarkets, you cannot find whole fish with heads and bones, live shrimp with heads and shells, fresh octopus, fresh crabs, and other shellfish. Even seaweed is only available in dried form and is considered purely Japanese. Although the climate in England is mild and all kinds of strange fruits and vegetables can thrive, the flag bearers only collect these things in their gardens and never serve them on the dining table. The recipes and cooking methods of English flag bearers always appear in a form that resembles the extreme scarcity of the early Middle Ages, almost close to darkness. If you go to Belgium, at the same latitude, you will find that Belgians eat steamed mussels stewed in white wine with herbs and grilled pork ribs with barbecue sauce. If you go to northern Germany at the same latitude, you will find that Germans eat pure meat sausages and large pork knuckles. Even in similar latitudes in Russia, you can find delicious potato salads, braised beef in cans, homemade cabbage soup, and kvass. After staying in England for a long time, I traveled to Sweden for a layover and was almost moved to tears. The nuts sold in a convenience store there were not overly salty or bitter, with no saliva taste and were very crispy. The packaged candies didn\\'t have an overpowering artificial flavor, didn\\'t overwhelm the nose, and were soft and not sticky to the teeth. The pastries sold in a coffee shop were not dry, but instead tasty and not greasy. The coffee was not bitter or scalding, but smooth and fragrant. You shouldn\\'t even think about finding these things in the flag bearer area; it\\'s purely a dream. I feel embarrassed to mention Chinese tea; even the branches of Earl Grey tea made by Turkish, Italian, and even Parisian old chocolate shops as side dishes were better than the three major English tea brands combined. Except for gin, which is a local product, all other good drinks are from France and Portugal. Does England not produce anything else? No, although my garden is full of flowers, there is a dense network of rivers and a mild climate, with excellent ecology, what does all of this have to do with my dining table? I have experienced dishes of a similar level only in tent guesthouses in the Sahara Desert. I had to drive three hours south from the southernmost city in Morocco, then change to a jeep and drive over sand for forty minutes to reach a tent in a Berber nomadic camp. Is it that they don\\'t want to or can\\'t make good food? It is simply because nothing else grows there, and even in these conditions, they still struggle to add olives and lemon to season their food. I ate street-side vendors\\' half-cooked roasted chestnuts on the streets of Turkey without lifting my head. When my childhood friend, who came to visit from China, took a bite, he couldn\\'t understand it. I shouted out, \"This is so delicious! Damn it, why don\\'t the English make this kind of food? This is so delicious!\" Squirrels and rabbits run around in the core area of England, with ducks and geese wandering everywhere. In my hometown, if you grow these things, they will freeze to death, so you can only dream about them. But English flag bearers are very good at creating extreme scarcity in an environment with no difficulties and making the most of it. Third, the level of interference and obstruction of rules is at the level of bizarre disturbances, making you doubt your own sanity and mental state. As mentioned above, just like the pomegranate, which is used as vinegar in Iran, in flag bearer supermarkets, you think you are buying mangoes, melons, strawberries, oranges, apples, and plums, but when you take a bite, you realize you are actually buying radishes, radishes, radishes, radishes, radishes, and radishes, and they are all tasteless and not crispy like a radish. The price of the fruit in flag bearer stores doesn\\'t change based on its quality. Unless you go to shops run by Middle Eastern and third brothers, it\\'s almost impossible to buy anything edible. The fruit in English flag bearer stores is not a natural creation under the sun but a miserable remnant of the logistics industry. Furthermore, despite trying many fillet steaks in flag bearer restaurants, from cheap neighborhood eateries to upscale professional restaurants, I cannot believe that all of them disintegrate when you insert the fork and even resemble meatballs. Even the £20 fillet steak looks the same as any other fillet steak on the outside, but when you try to cut it, it falls apart like a meatball. The £30 fillet steak falls apart as well, and so does the £50 fillet steak. At the end of the day, a fillet steak is not a high-end item. From an economic history perspective, it is actually a product of economies of scale in an industry. In the Americas, you can eat a quite decent fillet steak for £20, and a special steakhouse that costs £30 will bring you pure joy. Even in northern areas, you can always find a decent piece of meat for £50 in the right place. But in the flag bearer area, you can only keep reminding yourself with these memories: a fillet steak is not like this, a fillet steak is not like this, a fillet steak is not like this, until eventually, you begin to doubt the validity of your memory. You have tried seventy to eighty different restaurants and are willing to spend more money, but you find that things are always the same. So, is a medium-rare fillet steak really a meatball that disintegrates as soon as you touch it, without a single drop of meat juice? Is a mango really a radish? What is a mango? What is a radish? Mango? Radish? Do mangoes really exist in the world? Do radishes really exist in the world? What is a fillet steak? What is a restaurant? What is food? Who am I? Mango mango mango radish radish radish fillet steak fillet steak fillet steak meatball meatball meatball restaurant restaurant restaurant, I-I-I-I-I, pomegranate! Radish! Restaurant! Radish! Lion\\'s head! Ah! San value reset. How much mental trauma can this cause to someone who considers eating good food as their motivation for living? The food and restaurants in England appear very decent and respectable. The flag bearers and their culture also appear very decent and respectable. These types of industries in England are not marketing; they are at the level of pyramid schemes. Australia is where England sent its criminals, and England is where the world sent its chefs who committed crimes. In the past, I applauded when Boris Johnson came to power, believing it was a significant milestone in the great exchange of homes. If a group of beings occupied a piece of precious land on Earth that was rich in natural resources and did not make proper use of its potential and instead contaminated all food into pig feed, it would be better to give it to Indians; at least they can cook very fragrant curries.'"
